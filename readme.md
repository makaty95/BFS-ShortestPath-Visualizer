## Bugs Faced along the developement process :
> - [x] Program crashes as vector out of bounds (random times). 
> - [x] Program crashes when clicking any of the buttons on the direct opening.

## Steps planned/made during the developement :
> - [x] Adding label class.
> - [x] Add text UI : to show number of cells scanned, shortest path cells count, clean cells. 
> - [x] Add Button class.
> - [x] Mouse cursor on button havoring/clicking.
> - [x] Generating random maze on the grid.	
> - [x] Button class auto resize text.
> - [x] Button class center text aligning.
> - [x] transform color boxes to buttons (optimization)
> - [x] Add checkbox class.
> - [x] Add checkbox for diagonal moving.
> - [ ] complete all text alignment	functions in the Button class.

> ## *Phase I (BFS Algorithm)*
>> - [x] BFS implementation and visualizing.
>> - [x] Implementation of UIME.h file for UI components like buttons, textBoxes, ect..
>> - [x] Phase I debugging and fixing.
>> - [ ] Optimizations for phase I.
> ## *Phase II (Dijkstra Algorithm)*
>> - [ ] BFS implementation and visualizing.
>> - [ ] Optimizations for phase II.
